# CriticCompatibility
# Overview
A Django web app to allow users to review games without knowing their aggregate review score. After scoring multiple games, the user can then run a "critic match" that matches them up with reviewers based on how compatible their scores are. The user then can check out their top matches' Metacritic profiles and websites to look out for other games their compatible reviewers rated well.

# Tech Used
1. Django (Python, HTML, CSS, SQLite)
2. BeautifulSoup (Python package) for webscraping Metacritic for game/reviewer data
